# Customer-Churn-Predictor
This project predicts customer churn using supervised machine learning models and quantifies the associated financial exposure through a Revenue-at-Risk (RaR) framework applied to a telecom customer portfolio. The study evaluates whether Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers can effectively identify churn-prone customers while supporting risk-adjusted revenue estimation. The workflow covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction via PCA, customer segmentation with K-Means, class balancing using SMOTE, supervised modelling, and model explainability through SHAP values. Random Forest achieved the highest churn-specific recall (0.89), minimizing false negatives by correctly identifying 89% of all churned customers, with comparable overall accuracy (0.83). K-Means clustering identified a targetable segment capturing 68.1% of all churned customers. The RaR framework translates model-estimated churn probabilities into expected monetary loss, enabling the quantification of revenue exposure from customers likely to discontinue service. SHAP analysis revealed technical support tickets, charged amount, and customer tenure as the most influential churn drivers.
